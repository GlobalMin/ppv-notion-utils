# Code of Conduct

## Placeholder


:::{note}
When working with this template on Windows,
configure your text editor or IDE
to use only [UNIX-style line endings] (line feeds).

Nonetheless, configuring your editor for line feeds is recommended
to avoid complaints from the [pre-commit] hook for Prettier.

### Getting Python (Windows)

If you're on Windows,
download the recommended installer for the latest stable release of Python
from the official [Python website].
Before clicking **Install now**,
enable the option to add Python to your `PATH` environment variable.

Verify your installation by checking the output of the following commands in a new terminal window:

```
python -VV
py -VV
```
